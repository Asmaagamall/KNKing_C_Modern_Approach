### Exercise 2.06
Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore (as in ‘current___balance’, for example)?


### Solutions
An identifier with multiple consecutive underscores are difficult to read. It is hard to determine exactly how many underscore characters there are in the identifier,  the use of multiple underscores serves no purpose, and make the name of identifier long.
